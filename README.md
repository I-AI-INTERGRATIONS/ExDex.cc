# ExDex.cc

ExDex.cc is an early-bird showcase of the EXDEX/AF1 bridge system for managing cryptocurrency
transactions. The project provides a sample frontend that interacts with EXDEX services
for prepaid card issuance and other wallet functionality.

This site also highlights the DataToken Câ€‘4 server and the **RIPTIDE** protocol (formerly spelled
"DRIPTIDE"). RIPTIDE drives a 100% trustless network where data is tokenized and operations are
fully automated by AI. The goal is to simplify infrastructure while preserving transparency and
anonymity for all users.

Only EXDEX-approved smart contracts are accepted by the bridge. All contract logic is
pre-written and audited as part of the platform; third-party smart contracts cannot be
deployed or executed through this site.

This repository contains static web assets only. The backend services and contract code
are maintained separately and must be configured before deploying a production instance.
