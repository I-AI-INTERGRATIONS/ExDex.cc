- MongoDB for user data
- PostgreSQL for transaction data

### Security Components
- DRIPTIDE Protocol: End-to-end encryption across all systems
- RIPTIDE Protection: Anti-tampering measures for all transactions
- Sentinel AI: Behavioral analysis and anomaly detection
- ExDe Encryption: Military-grade data security

## Data Flow
1. All user interactions start at public-facing domains
2. Authentication requests route through opsec.exdex.cc
3. API calls processed by api.exdex.cc with validation
4. Trading operations managed by pool.exdex.cc
5. Financial services handled by shop.exdex.cc
6. All sensitive data logged and stored in secure databases

## Deployment Strategy
- Each subdomain deployed as separate application
- Shared libraries for common functionality
- Centralized logging and monitoring
- Blue/Green deployment for zero-downtime updates
- Automated scaling based on traffic patterns

## Security Protocol
- All credentials logged for recovery
- Complete transaction history maintained
- Key rotation schedule
- Regular security audits
- Incident response procedures

## Next Steps
1. Create domain-specific codebases
2. Establish shared libraries and services
3. Configure cross-domain authentication
4. Implement logging and monitoring
5. Deploy staging environments
6. Security testing
7. Production deployment
