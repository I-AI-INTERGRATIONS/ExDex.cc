## System Architecture

![BHE Ecosystem Architecture](BHE_Ecosystem_Architecture.svg)

This diagram shows the complete architecture of the BHE ecosystem, including:
- User interfaces (main dashboard, staking, fiat gateway, trading)
- Backend and node layers (API, RPC, smart contracts, home node, automation, bug aspect, encryption)
- Data and wallet management
- Secure flows for staking, trading, fiat/crypto, bug reporting, and encryption

For a detailed breakdown of each component and flow, see the `.mmd` file and in-code documentation.
