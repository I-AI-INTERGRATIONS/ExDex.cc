# ExDEX Website Structure

This directory hosts the deployment skeleton for the ExDEX website. It contains Docker and configuration files needed to run a development instance.

The folder was previously named `stucture`; update any build scripts or deployment configurations to reference `website/structure` instead.

A reference copy of the original site is provided as `PROXGUARD.WEBSITE_.zip`.

When deploying the site, make sure the backend node exposes the smart contract panels and pool management interfaces. These endpoints can then be accessed via your XDEX dashboard for editing and pool access.
