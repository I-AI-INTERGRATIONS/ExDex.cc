# ExDEX Website Structure

This folder contains the deployment skeleton for hosting the ExDEX website. It includes Docker and configuration files needed to run a development instance.

The directory was previously named `stucture`. Any build scripts or deployment configurations should refer to the new path `website/structure`.

When deploying the site, ensure the backend node exposes the smart contract panels and pool management interfaces. These endpoints can then be accessed via your XDEX dashboard for editing and pool access.
